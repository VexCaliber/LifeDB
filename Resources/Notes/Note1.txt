Alrighty, so I wanna throw a couple things out here

Had to take a few days to deal with taxes and decompress.  That and screen time is screwing with my head & eyes...

This will probably just serve as the basis for a new version.  Whilst I wanted to do the loose coupling, I went the brute force route and this project doesn't live up to what I 
wanted really.  Not exactly extensible.  

Still waiting on the look and fix for deletions...I honestly don't wanna touch it or look at it at this point.  Been quite busy lately.

I'm gonna still try to get this done and get a second version going that'll achieve what I wanted here, 
but I do have to throw it out there...I may have to throw dev/coding away to get a normal job again.

With cash drying up and these self righteous "quants" refusing to hire me, I may end up having to walk away from things.

It's great how they expect multiple public projects, and "proofs" whilst you're not getting paid for it, 
and slowly bankrupting yourself for the "opportunity" to maybe be considered one day...assuming you don't go homeless or starve first, 
then oh no...they couldn't possibly consider you.

It's such scummy b/s.  Like...do they realize things cost money??  I know they have coffee spilling out from golden horse dxcks in big tech, 
but do they know that most people only make 30-50k a year?  Do they know that being a glorified text editor costs time and money...because existence has a price?

Idk, but honestly I may go into the depths and just start building lists of all the software they offer and make my own.  I mean, if they won't hire me, then I guess
I'll just have to generate better shxt at the tenth the price and do direct customer service...beat em' to bankruptcy.

Meh...whatever...
