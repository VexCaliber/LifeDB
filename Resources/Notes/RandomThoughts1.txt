So...just throwing this out there...

I'm fairly certain that the Mandella Effect is a result of Quantum Computing.  Like a multi-universal memory leak.

You expect to see a stick, but it's index was shifted, leading you to get a rock or some other tile in its place.

Eventually...if the indexes coming into our reality are from other parallels...would this not lead to collisions of multiple sister universes with our own?
Leading to an eventual corruption beyond reconciliation...?  Collapsing multiple realities together, completely mixing histories together to the point of madness?

One of the more recent ones in the cornucopia from Fruit of the Loom.  I legit remember this one insanely brightly.  It did exist.  But it doesn't now?
They tried to write it off as knock-offs, but wth would you rip off FotL?  It's kinda discount and lame...it'd be like knocking off a megablock...absolutely pointless.

Gucci I could understand...but FotL?  Nah...there's way too much more you can make knocking off literally anything else. O.o
