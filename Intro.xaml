            Hello there!  So I must admit, this project went waaay off the rails compared
            to how I wanted to set this up.  Whatever it ultimately amounts to, at some point
            I'll work on a new variant that'll be loose enough to allow creating your own table,
            visually and simply, whilst hopefully retaining all the cool stuff I kinda had planned.
            
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            
            Although I will admit, third party api's that I was hoping existed before looking for them
            seem to be non-existent...at least in minimal terms as I would need.  So likely there will have to be
            a server behind this one day, assuming everything doesn't go straight to hell world wise... O.O
            
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            
            Anyway, that's all...don't have high expectations for this version. ;)
